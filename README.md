# VoiceMemos

This app is just a simple rewrite from Objective-C code. While reading a book called "*Learning AVFoundation*", I thought it'd be a cool exercise to rewrite the code written in Obj-C to Swift and "update" it a little bit :). The main functionality of the app is still in the works (just a couple of minor things to make it fully functional). One new thing is that the app contains an onboarding screen.

### TODO:
1. Fix the (visual) bug of the recording button not resetting to its initial state after stopping the recording
2. Audio Playback
3. File export
